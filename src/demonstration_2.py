"""
You are given a non-empty array that represents the digits of a non-negative integer.
​
Write a function that increments the number by 1.
​
The digits are stored so that the digit representing the most significant place value is at the beginning of the array. Each element in the array only contains a single digit.
​
You will not receive a leading 0 in your input array (except for the number 0 itself).
​
Example 1:
​
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3]
Explanation: The input array represents the integer 132. 132 + 1 = 133.
​
Example 2:
​
Input: [3,2,1,9]
Output: [3,2,2,0]
Explanation: The input array represents the integer 3219. 3219 + 1 = 3220.
​
Example 3:
​
Input: [9,9,9]
Output: [1,0,0,0]
Explanation: The input array represents the integer 999. 999 + 1 = 1000.
